We have implemented Cyclic redundancy check codes using JavaScript and html.<br />
Here we use HTML and CSS for the front-end .<br />
We used simple XOR to calculate the code word .<br />
We use simple XOR to decode also.<br />
We have implemented 1 bit error correction.The actual algorithm is to use idea of checksums and make tables <br />
But every divisor will have its own table and using that is not easy. So, we used an alternative<br /> 
We change every bit at once and check it. <br /> 
The code is properly indendated.<br /> 
The buttons on the navigation bar gives brief idea about CRC,Polynomials or divisors ,1 bit error correction algorithm.<br />
For detailed reading a link is attached bellow it.<br />

An web based tool for CRC codes<br />
### Description of files: 
* The was initially written in c++ files ```crc1.cpp``` ```2.crc2.cpp```
* ```DC1.html``` file contains the main code as per the above logic .
* ```t.html``` file contains a breif description of CRC.
* ```t2.html``` file contaons a brief description of Property of Divisor.
* ```t3.html``` file contains a brief description of 1-bit error checking code.
### To run the program:<br />
* Run the command <br />
```
git clone https://github.com/Sohamraje137/cyclic-redundancy-check
```
* Enter the project directory by entering <br />
```
cd cyclic-redundancy-check
```

* open DC1.html using any browser

### Hosting Website
* We have hosted the Web-based tool on our github.Please visit the below link to test it. <br />
