# cyclic-redundancy-check

Question no. A. 7.
We have implemented Cyclic redundancy check codes using javascript and html.
Here we use HTML and CSS for the front-end .
We use simple XOR to calculate the code word .
We use simple XOR to decode also.
We have implemented 1 bit error checker.The actual algorithm is to use idea of checksums and make tables ;
But every divisor will have its own table and using that is not easy. So, we use a alternate 
We change every bit at once and check it. 
The code is properly indendated.
