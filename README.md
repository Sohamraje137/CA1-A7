# Cyclic-Redundancy-Check

## Question no. A. 7.
<br />
We have implemented Cyclic redundancy check codes using JavaScript and html.<br />
Here we use HTML and CSS for the front-end .<br />
We used simple XOR to calculate the code word .<br />
We use simple XOR to decode also.<br />
We have implemented 1 bit error correction.The actual algorithm is to use idea of checksums and make tables <br />
But every divisor will have its own table and using that is not easy. So, we used an alternative<br /> 
We change every bit at once and check it. <br /> 
The code is properly indendated.<br /> 
The buttons on the navigation bar gives brief idea about CRC,Polynomials or divisors ,1 bit error correction algorithm.<br />
For detailed reading a link is attached bellow it.<br />


An web based tool for CRC codes<br />
